Welcome to ForGe, a computer forensic test image generator.

ForGe currently supports NTFS and FAT file systems (file actions not yet
supported in FAT).  Follow installation instructions (run the installation
script and pre_populate database), and follow these steps to start using
ForGe:


1) Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ui/main to get started

2) Choose "Trivial files" and drag & drop trivial files to the repository.
   Good trivial files are smallish and of various types. ForGe detects
   images, audio files, documents, executables and certain other file types.
   However, the categorisation can be changed in admin view

3) Choose "Secret files" and drag & drop hidden file candidates to upload
   them to repository. 



Now a case can be created. This requires the admin interface
http://localhost:8000/admin/ui. Use the username/passwd prompted when 
initialising Django database.

4) Assign categories to hidden files. Choose "hidden file items" and 
   change "group" for each item to non-zero. Groups can be anything numerical
   and a group can have none, one or several files in it. 

5) Create a case. 
   Fsparam1 is the cluster size in sectors (4 = 2048 etc). 
   NOTE FAT file systems: you can choose between FAT12/FAT16/FAT32. However,
   Linux mkfs.msdos generally returns an error if a file system / number of 
   clusters combination is abnormal. Smaller FAT sizes have their limitations
   but it seems to be impossible to create a small FAT32 image. By choosing 
   only "FAT", the cluster size paramter is ignored and a "suitable" FAT
   file system size is chosen automatically. This is strongly recommended. 
   If you want to choose manually, I have been able to create a FAT12 file 
   system with 3M file size, FAT16 with 25M file size and FAT32 with 256M
   file size, with cluster size 4

6) Create at least one trivial strategy. This puts the "bulk" on file systems,
   for example /holiday containing pictures and /doc containing documents. 
   ForGe chooses randomly the requested amount of trivial files from the 
   repository

7) Create secret strategies. This is the data hiding functionality. Group
   references to secret file groups (4). If a file is alone in its group,
   it will be hidden in each image. If a group is formed of several files, 
   exactly one is chosen randomly. 
   File actions and instructions are optional (actions currently not supported
   in FAT), read the enclosed documentation about actions. 

8) Return to the main user interface. Choose "Images" and create 

9) If curious, display cheat sheets in "Solutions" after image creation.
